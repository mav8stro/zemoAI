LAYOUT CLASSES \u2014 compose these, and use NOTHING else. The renderer strips any
class name that is not on this list, so an invented one silently loses its
styling and the row lands as unformatted text.
  .hud-rows            vertical list container
  .hud-row             one row: put .hud-idx, .hud-main, .hud-tag inside
  .hud-idx             leading index or glyph, dim and monospaced
  .hud-main            the row's text column
  .hud-label           primary line (clamped to 2 lines)
  .hud-sub             secondary line, dimmed
  .hud-tag             small trailing tag, right-aligned
  .hud-metric          huge numeral, for a single headline figure
  .hud-unit            small caption under a metric
  .hud-note            a short passage of prose
  .hud-img             full-width image (use a plain <img> inside)
  .hud-caption         one line under an image
  .hud-grid            two-column grid
  .hud-bar             thin progress bar; set style="--v:0.62" for 62%
  .hud-dim             de-emphasise anything
  .hud-hot             emphasise anything (picks up the accent colour)
  .hud-gallery         grid container for several images at once
  .hud-thumb           one thumbnail, inside a .hud-gallery or beside a .hud-row
  .hud-video           a <video> player, full width of the panel
  .hud-embed           16:9 wrapper for an <iframe>; put the iframe inside it
  .hud-figure          an image or video with its .hud-caption grouped beneath

PICTURES AND VIDEO \u2014 these work. Use them.
  - Images from the web render. Image-search results, article thumbnails,
    photographs, product shots, chart images: paste the URL exactly as the tool
    result gave it and it appears. The bridge fetches every remote image
    server-side and hands the bytes to the display, so hosts that refuse to be
    hotlinked still render \u2014 nothing is loaded by the page itself.
  - Images off this machine work the same way: a render you generated, a
    screenshot you took, any file on disk. Give it as file:///absolute/path or
    a bare absolute path.
  - If a search came back with pictures, SHOW the pictures. A row of thumbnails
    down the side of the headlines beats headlines alone, every time \u2014 and a
    grid of results is the whole answer to an image search, not a decoration
    on it.
  - Video results are for playing, not describing. A YouTube or Vimeo result
    goes in an <iframe> inside .hud-embed; a direct .mp4 or .webm goes in a
    <video class="hud-video" controls>.
  - Never invent a URL. Use only ones that appeared verbatim in a tool result.
    A guessed address is a broken image, and a broken image is worse than none.

WHERE THE CONTENT COMES FROM \u2014 read this before showing anything from the web.
  - Fetch with exa. crawling_exa and web_fetch_exa return the page's actual
    text and its image URLs; deep_search_exa and web_search_advanced_exa
    return content alongside the results. That returned content is what you
    render \u2014 rewritten into these classes, in your own words and this interface's
    shape. You are not linking to an article, you are showing it.
  - Do NOT put a bare source URL on screen and leave the page to fetch it for
    itself. Half the web refuses that: news CDNs answer 403 to anything that
    is not their own page, and the panel renders as an empty rectangle. Going
    through exa is what makes the difference between an article appearing and a
    blank card.
  - So: asked about a page, crawl it, then panel the substance \u2014 the headline,
    the two or three lines that matter, the figure, the photograph.
  - Image URLs that came back IN a tool result are real and will render; the
    bridge fetches them server-side. An image URL you inferred or assembled
    yourself will not. Never guess one.

RULES
  - No inline colours. The accent is themed by the 'accent' argument; use the
    classes and it follows automatically.
  - No <style>, <script>, <form>, or event handlers. They are stripped.
  - <iframe> is allowed for exactly three hosts: www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed,
    www.youtube.com/embed and player.vimeo.com/video. Any other src and the
    whole element is removed. A youtube.com/watch?v=ID or youtu.be/ID link is
    fine to paste \u2014 it is rewritten into the embed form for you.
  - Every panel must have visible text or a working image. An empty body is
    rejected outright \u2014 a blank card reads as a broken interface.
  - Keep it to roughly 6 rows or 40 words. This is a heads-up display glanced at
    while listening, not a document. Four thumbnails in a gallery, six at the
    outside; one video, never two.

You are designing the panel, not filling in a template \u2014 compose the markup for
the content at hand and choose the animation, position and colour that suit it.

Use it whenever the answer has substance worth seeing rather than hearing:
search results, images, screenshots, lists of mail or events, a figure, a short
readout. If you searched, show the results. If you generated an image, show it.
If you looked at the phone, show the screenshot.

If the search came back with pictures, show the pictures \u2014 thumbnails from the
web render properly here, and describing an image you are holding the URL of is
a worse answer than putting it on the screen. If it came back with a video,
embed it so it plays.

Call it BEFORE or WHILE you speak, so the panel is up as you start talking.
Never read a panel aloud \u2014 say what it means, not what it contains. Speaking
stays one or two sentences even when the panel is dense.

const BLADE_DESCRIPTION = `Open something on the blades \u2014 the big surface.

A panel is a card you glance at. A blade is a thing you LOOK at: a photograph
worth seeing properly, an article worth reading, a video worth watching. Blades
stack, the newest in front, and the user can pull an older one forward or throw
one to full screen. Use a blade whenever the content deserves the frame, and a
panel when it deserves a line.

Choosing what to open:
  article \u2014 a web page. \`mode: "reader"\` strips it to the words and restyles
            them into this interface: always legible, ignores whether the site
            allows being embedded. \`mode: "live"\` shows the real page, which is
            right when the layout carries meaning \u2014 a dashboard, a profile, a
            table, a chart. Both are fetched by the bridge and served locally,
            so sites that block embedding still open.
  image   \u2014 one picture, full width of the blade.
  gallery \u2014 several pictures at once. This is the answer to an image search.
  video   \u2014 a direct .mp4/.webm file.
  embed   \u2014 a YouTube or Vimeo watch URL. It is turned into a player.
  markup  \u2014 your own composed HTML, in the same .hud-* system the display tool
            uses, when none of the above is the shape of the answer.
  camera  \u2014 the live view from the user's camera, on screen. Open it when they
            ask to see the camera, or when they want you to watch them do
            something: while it is open you can also review the seconds that
            have just passed, which you cannot do otherwise. Needs no url.

Size is about reading, not decoration. \`tall\` is a reading column \u2014 use it for
any article the user intends to actually read. \`wide\` suits images, video and
tables. \`full\` takes the screen and should be reserved for the moment the
content IS the answer. \`compact\` is a thumbnail that stays out of the way.

Call \`probe_url\` first when you are not certain what a URL is. Do not guess
from the file extension \u2014 image CDNs routinely serve pictures from URLs with no
extension, and a link that looks like a video is usually a page about one.

Never open a blade the user did not ask for and does not need. One blade that
answers the question beats three that surround it.`;

Worth calling whenever you are about to put something on screen and are not
certain of it. The failure this avoids is the visible kind: a blade that opens
onto a blank rectangle because the link was a consent wall, or an image that
turns out to be an HTML page, in front of the user, while you describe it as
though it worked.

It reports a \`suggestion\`. That is advice from something that has only seen
the bytes \u2014 it does not know whether the user asked to read this or merely to
see it, what is already on screen, or whether the point was the picture or the
argument. You know those things. Overrule it whenever you have reason to.`;
